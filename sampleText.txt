n addition to its low overhead, 
tqdm uses smart algorithms to predict
the remaining time and to skip unnecessary 
iteration displays, which allows for a negligible
overhead in most cases.
tqdm works on any platform 
(Linux, Windows, Mac, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris/SunOS),
in any console or in a GUI, and is also friendly 
with IPython/Jupyter notebooks.
